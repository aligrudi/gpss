GENERAL POSITION SUBSET SELECTION ALGORITHMS
============================================

This repository contains four algorithms for General Position Subset
Selection (GPSS).

* gpss: Implements GPSS algorithms; takes a linear hypergraph as input.
  It prints four numbers: the number of points followed by the size
  of the set returned by Ind, Inc, Inc-Min, and Dec.
* datran: Generates random linear hypergraphs.
* datpts: Places points on the plane according to some pattern.
* datgen: Extract the collinearity hypergraph from a set of points.
* datcnf: Some known configurations, printed as hypergraphs.

The script dat.sh invokes datran, datpts, and datcnf to generate the
test cases.
